**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous role, I was responsible for managing a section of a core banking system within a larger project. The company I worked for developed software infrastructure for financial institutions, including banks and insurance firms. While my role didn’t involve overall project leadership, I was still heavily involved in managing specific technical aspects of the core banking platform, which was a critical system for our clients.

From an ethical standpoint, one of the key challenges was managing the workload among team members while ensuring fairness. Even though I wasn’t the primary decision-maker, I worked closely with my team to balance responsibilities and make sure that no one was overburdened, especially during demanding phases of the project. It was essential to foster a collaborative atmosphere where everyone felt supported, and this often required careful attention to how tasks were distributed. While the broader direction came from senior management, I took personal responsibility for ensuring that within my scope, the work was distributed ethically and transparently.

In terms of inequity, while I wasn’t in a position to influence company-wide policies, I still recognized the importance of fostering inclusivity within my team. The tech industry, particularly in financial software, tends to struggle with diversity, so I made efforts to ensure that all team members, regardless of their background, had an equal opportunity to contribute. This included creating an environment where everyone’s ideas were valued and making sure no one felt marginalized.

When technical issues or crises arose within my section of the project, I made it a priority to handle them with transparency and integrity. Although I wasn’t leading the entire project, I felt responsible for ensuring that problems were communicated honestly to both the senior leadership and the clients. This often required working closely with other teams to resolve issues quickly and efficiently, while also maintaining accountability for the parts of the system I managed.

If I were to adjust my approach further, I would focus on embedding ethical considerations more formally within the team’s workflow. Even in a smaller role, it’s important to create structures that encourage ethical decision-making and promote inclusivity, regardless of the scope of the project. By doing so, even those in less senior positions can contribute to a more ethical and equitable working environment.
